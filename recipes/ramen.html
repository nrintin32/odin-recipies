        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>If you're a spicy food lover, you've likely seen Buldak Ramen exploding in popularity. It's everywhere now, available in stores and online.</p>
        <p>Buldak ramen is actually the invention of South Korean company, Samyang Foods, based on the popular Korean street food, Buldak.</p>
        <p>Buldak translates to "fire chicken", and is a fiery dish of chicken cooked in a spicy gochujang sauce. Inspired by the popularity of the dish, Samyang created this ramen instant noodles version called "Fire Chicken Stir Fried Noodes", or "buldak-bokkeum-myeon".</p>
        <p>Samyang offers a variety of flavors. This is my own homemade buldak ramen, which makes it extra spicy with lots of Korean gochujang, a fermented Korean chili paste, and gochugaru, Korean chili flakes, among other spicy ingredients.</p>
